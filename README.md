# languages-benchmark

Collection of minified scripts in various languages to be able to compare their performance.

Results should be treated with caution as the language "speed" depends on too many factors.
I use these scripts mainly when learning new languages, assessing limitations imposed on
tasks for [CodeAbbey](https://www.codeabbey.com) or considering rewriting of some bottleneck
fragments.

There are several subfolders because we may expect that performance depends on specific
task, data structures used etc.
